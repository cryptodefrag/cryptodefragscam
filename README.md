## 1. What is Crypto Market Fragmentation? <a name="fragmentation"></a>

**Crypto market fragmentation** refers to the division of liquidity and trading activity across numerous exchanges and trading venues. Unlike traditional finance, where a small number of centralized exchanges dominate trading volume, the crypto market is spread across hundreds of platformsâ€”each with their own order books, pricing, and liquidity.

### Causes of Fragmentation

- **Proliferation of Exchanges:** There are over 500 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, both centralized and decentralized.
- **Variety of Tokens:** Tens of thousands of tokens are listed on different platforms, with many exclusive to particular exchanges.
- **Regional Regulations:** Jurisdictional restrictions result in different platforms serving different regions.
- **DeFi Growth:** Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) have grown rapidly, further splitting liquidity.

### Impact

- **Price Discrepancies:** The same asset may have different prices on different exchanges.
- **Inefficient Trading:** Traders may not get the best price due to isolated liquidity pools.
- **Higher Slippage:** Large orders can move the market more on low-liquidity venues.
- **Arbitrage Opportunities:** Price differences lead to arbitrage, but not all users can take advantage.
